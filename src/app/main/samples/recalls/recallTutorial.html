		<div class="md-dialog-content-body">
			<p>Ques Cards use a spaced repetition algorithm to help you learn more efficiently. Go through each card and choose the difficulty level once youâ€™ve answered it (1 being easiest and 5 the hardest). The more difficult you found the card the more it will be repeated and vice versa. This allows you to hone in on tricky facts faster and better commit them to your long-term memory.</p>
